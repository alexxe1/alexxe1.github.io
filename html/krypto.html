                <br>
                The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.
                <br>

                <br>
                Third-party service providers used by the app:
                <br>
                - Google Play Services

                <br>

                <br>
                I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data
                and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include
                information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version,

                <br>
                Cookies
                <br>

                <br>
                Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
                These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal
                memory.
                <br>

                <br>
                This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and
                libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to
                either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose
                to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

                Service Providers
                <br>

                <br>
                I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
                <br>

                <br>
                To facilitate our Service;
                To provide the Service on our behalf;
                To perform Service-related services; or
                To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
                I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal
                Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are
                obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                <br>

                <br>
                Security
                <br>

                <br>
                I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
                acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or
                method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                <br>

                <br>
                Links to Other Sites

                This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed
                to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
                review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the

                These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally

                parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please

            <h2 class="titles">Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p class="text-content">
                By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
                therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the
                app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the
                source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make
                derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other
                intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to alexe1dev.<br><br>

                alexe1dev is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason,
                we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any
                reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly
                what you’re paying for.<br><br>

                The Krypto app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my Service.
                It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that
                you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and
                limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
                to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that
                the Krypto app won’t work properly or at all.<br><br>

                The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.<br><br>

                Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the app<br><br>

                - Google Play Services<br>- AdMob<br>- Unity<br><br>You should be aware that there are certain things
                that alexe1dev will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to
                have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network
                provider, but alexe1dev cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you
                don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.<br><br>

                If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the
                agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
                mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
                other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
                including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or
                country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
                using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
                using the app.<br><br>

                Along the same lines, alexe1dev cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
                need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
                avail the Service, alexe1dev cannot accept responsibility.<br><br>

                With respect to alexe1dev’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
                important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all
                times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you.
                alexe1dev accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
                wholly on this functionality of the app.<br><br>

                At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the
                requirements for the system(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the
                app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. alexe1dev
                does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
                Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to
                the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use
                of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
                termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using
                the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.<br><br>

                Changes to This Terms and Conditions<br><br>

                I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions
                on this page.<br><br>

                These terms and conditions are effective as of 2022-09-17<br><br>
