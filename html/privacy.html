    <h2>Krypto Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      alexe1dev built the Krypto app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by alexe1dev at no cost and is intended for
      use as is.

      This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
      Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

      If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this
      policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or
      share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

      The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible
      at Krypto unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

      <b>Information Collection and Use</b>

      For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally
      identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by
      me in any way.

      The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

      Link to the privacy policy of third-party service providers used by the app

      - Google Play Services
      - AdMob
      - Unity
      - Log Data

      I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I collect data and
      information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information
      such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of
      the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

      <b>Cookies</b>

      Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are
      sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.

      This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that
      use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse
      these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may
      not be able to use some portions of this Service.

      <b>Service Providers</b>

      I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

      To facilitate our Service;
      To provide the Service on our behalf;
      To perform Service-related services; or
      To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
      I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information. The
      reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use
      the information for any other purpose.

      <b>Security</b>

      I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable
      means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
      storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

      <b>Links to Other Sites</b>

      This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that
      site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
      Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy
      policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

      <b>Children’s Privacy</b>

      These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
      information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with
      personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are
      aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do
      the necessary actions.

      <b>Changes to This Privacy Policy</b>

      I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any
      changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

      This policy is effective as of 2022-09-17
