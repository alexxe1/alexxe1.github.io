    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p class="text-content__privacy">
      This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of
      Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

      If you choose to use any of my services, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to
      this policy.

      For a better experience, while using any of our services, I may require you to provide me with certain
      personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be retained on your device and
      is not collected by me in any way.

      The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

      Third-party service providers used by the app might be:

      - Google Play Services
      - AdMob
      - Unity
      - Log Data

      I want to inform you that whenever you use my services, in a case of an error in the app, I collect data
      and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include
      information such as your device name, operating system version,
      the configuration of the app when utilizing my service, the time and date of your use of the service,
      and other statistics.

      <b>Cookies</b>

      Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
      These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal
      memory.

      My services do not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and
      libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to
      either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device.

      <b>Service Providers</b>

      I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

      - To facilitate my services
      - To provide my service on my behalf
      - To perform service-related services
      - To assist us in analyzing how our service is used.

      <b>Security</b>

      I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
      acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or
      method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

      <b>Links to Other Sites</b>

      This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed
      to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
      review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the
      content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

      <b>Children's Privacy</b>

      These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally
      identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under
      13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a
      parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please
      contact me so that I will be able to do the necessary actions.

      <b>Changes to This Privacy Policy</b>

      I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
      periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this
      page.

      This policy is effective as of 2022-09-17

    <h2 class="titles">Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p class="text-content__terms">
      By downloading or using any of my apps, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
      therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You`re not allowed to copy or modify the
      app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You`re not allowed to attempt to extract the
      source code of the app, and you also shouldn`t try to translate the app into other languages or make
      derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other
      intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to alexe1dev.

      alexe1dev is committed to ensuring that their apps is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason,
      we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any
      reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly
      what you`re paying for.

      All apps store and process personal data that you have provided to us, to provide my service.
      It`s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that
      you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and
      limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable
      to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone`s security features and it could mean that
      the Krypto app won`t work properly or at all.

      The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.

      A list of the third-party service providers that might be used by the apps:

      - Google Play Services
      - AdMob
      - Unity

      You should be aware that there are certain things that alexe1dev will not take responsibility for.
      Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection.
      The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but alexe1dev
      cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you
      don`t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don`t have any of your data allowance left.

      If you`re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the
      agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your
      mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or
      other third-party charges. In using the app, you`re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
      including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or
      country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you`re
      using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for
      using the app.

      Along the same lines, alexe1dev cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
      need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can`t turn it on to
      avail the service, alexe1dev cannot accept responsibility.

      With respect to alexe1dev`s responsibility for your use of the app, when you`re using the app, it`s
      important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all
      times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you.
      alexe1dev accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying
      wholly on this functionality of the app.

      <b>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</b>

      I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
      periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions
      on this page.

      These terms and conditions are effective as of 2022-09-17
